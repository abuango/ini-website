## Recommended Replacements
- inaccurate information (noun)
- *create* or *generate* inaccurate information (verb)

## Unsuitable Replacements
None

## Rationale
Hallucinations -- perceptions that are not based in reality -- are often associated with mental illness or drug use. Using the term in a technology context, in either its noun or verb form, can be seen as insensitive to people who experience those conditions.
