## Rationale
The term *blast radius* comes from warcraft. It refers to the extent of damage caused by an explosion. Many people, including but not limited to those who have served in the military or lived in war zones, could experience triggered reactions or otherwise take offense. 

Additionally, *blast radius* is not universally known within the IT community, and there is a high risk of it being mistranslated. Both of the recommended replacement terms are clear and unambiguous.
