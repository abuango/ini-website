definition: "N/A"

unsuitable_replacements:
    - N/A

rationale: |
    A totem pole is a sacred object in Indigenous communities and the bottom of the totem pole has a specific symbolic meaning. Additionally, describing someone or something as *bottom* or *low man* implies that they are somehow inferior â€“ which not only dishonors the symbolic meaning but is inaccurate.
    
    "Low man on the totem pole" is a good example here where there isn't a great alternative, because we're using generalized qualitative opinions about place in the hierarchy to infer capability or effectiveness. In this case, rather than identifying a replacement term, we need to encourage the user to utilize more specific language to get their point across.

    Some examples:
    - "I can't make a sale with this person because he's a low man on the totem pole" --> "I can't make a sale with this person because they cannot make buying decisions."
    
    - "The low man on the totem pole is the one who gets all the grunt work." --> "More junior team members are assigned more tedious, repetitive tasks."
