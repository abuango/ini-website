In a World Shaped by Words, What Message Are We Sending?

Language is more than just a tool for communication, it shapes our **perceptions, biases, and realities.** In the digital age, where technology influences nearly every aspect of our lives, the words we use in software, documentation, and branding hold immense power.

But here‚Äôs the issue: **many of the terms we‚Äôve normalized carry historical, cultural, or social biases that exclude, alienate, or reinforce harmful narratives.**

From **"master/slave"** in coding to **"blacklist/whitelist"** in cybersecurity, outdated language lingers, quietly shaping our industry‚Äôs culture in ways we don‚Äôt always notice. If we want to build a truly **inclusive** future, we must start with the foundation: **the words we choose.**

### Why Inclusive Naming Is More Than Just a Trend

Some may argue that ‚Äúwords are just words.‚Äù But here‚Äôs the truth:

üöÄ **Words shape culture** ‚Äì They influence how we think, communicate, and innovate.

üöÄ **Language evolves with society** ‚Äì Just as we update technologies, we must update the words we use to reflect progress.

üöÄ **Inclusion drives innovation** ‚Äì A diverse and inclusive industry attracts top talent, fosters collaboration, and pushes boundaries.

üöÄ **Brand reputation matters** ‚Äì Companies that embrace inclusive language show their commitment to diversity, equity, and respect.

### The Silent Impact of Exclusionary Language

Imagine being a young coder or tech enthusiast and stumbling upon **"master/slave architecture"** in a system. While this might seem like standard terminology to some, for others, it recalls painful histories of oppression.

Or consider **"blacklist" and "whitelist"** ‚Äî terms that **subconsciously** associate "black" with bad and "white" with good. While the intent may not be malicious, the impact is real.

Even in marketing, words like **"bossy" vs. "assertive," "aggressive" vs. "confident"** often differ based on **gender, race, or background.** These subtle biases reinforce stereotypes that influence hiring, promotions, and opportunities.

If we truly want to **create spaces where everyone feels valued, represented, and included,** we need to start by **choosing better words.**

### Inclusive Naming Is Not About "Cancel Culture" ‚ÄîI t‚Äôs About Building a Better Future

This movement isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúpolicing language.‚Äù It‚Äôs about **intentionally creating a culture where words reflect our values, not outdated norms.**

By embracing inclusive naming, we are not just changing words, we are changing **mindsets, systems, and industries** for the better.

### Why does language matter in Tech?

Language is more than syntax, It reflects the values and culture of a community. Words can shape how individuals see themselves and others. In the tech industry, many commonly used terms carry **problematic or exclusionary histories**, often alienating those from underrepresented backgrounds.

INI recognizes this and takes proactive steps to replace such terms with **neutral, inclusive alternatives,** ensuring that the future of tech is built with **empathy, awareness, and equity**.

### The Impact of Inclusive Naming

#### Better Developer Culture

Fosters a more respectful, inclusive, and forward-thinking tech environment where everyone feels safe and valued.

#### Global Alignment

Positions teams and organizations as **ethical leaders** in an increasingly inclusion-conscious world.

#### Fewer Barriers

Eliminates language that might discourage or exclude beginners, especially those from marginalized backgrounds.

#### Improved Accessibility

Inclusive terminology makes documentation and interfaces more understandable, especially for **non-native English speakers** and those new to tech.

#### Sustainable Change

A structured, well-documented process means inclusive naming becomes a **built-in standard**, not a one-time project.

### Goals of the Inclusive Naming Initiative

The INI project is grounded in three core goals:

- **Identify and eliminate** non-inclusive or potentially offensive language in codebases and documentation.
- **Promote inclusive alternatives** that are functional, widely understandable, and culturally neutral.
- **Support developers and organizations** in implementing these changes without disrupting user experience or breaking systems.

### Wordlist: What Are We Recommending?

It's important to identify the terms that need to be updated. A clear wordlist helps outline commonly used words or phrases that may be outdated, offensive, or unintentionally harmful, along with recommended alternatives. The Inclusive Naming Initiative‚Äôs [wordlists](https://inclusivenaming.org/word-lists/) contains terms recommended in 3 categories:

- [Tier 1 (Replace Immediately)](https://inclusivenaming.org/word-lists/tier-1/): Terms that should be replaced whenever encountered. 

- [Tier 2 (Strongly Consider Replacing)](https://inclusivenaming.org/word-lists/tier-2/): Terms that should be replaced whenever possible, barring major breaking changes.

- [Tier 3 (Replacement Recommended)](https://inclusivenaming.org/word-lists/tier-3/): Terms that should be considered for replacement.

### Recommended Implementation Plan

#### 1. Non-functional Words

These appear in documentation, web pages, or code comments. Since they don‚Äôt affect the actual code, feel free to improve clarity or tone by using better alternatives.

#### 2. Internal-Only Words

These include local variables or function names used solely within your project. Changes here are safe; just ensure all internal references are updated consistently.

#### 3. External-Facing Functional Words

These are names exposed through public APIs or configuration files. Changing them requires a **deprecation plan** to avoid breaking live systems or external integrations.

#### 4. Dependencies

These are calls to external services, APIs, or libraries. Typically can‚Äôt change them directly. We **encourage** using wrapper functions to keep your code clean and adaptable, even while relying on third-party tools.

### Downstream Impact Assessment

Every change has a ripple effect. INI assesses how updates might affect:

- Git workflows, branches, and commands.
- Downstream projects or integrations.
- Legacy systems that rely on deprecated terms.

Backward compatibility is maintained for a defined period, allowing time for all stakeholders to adapt.

### Tooling

To ensure a smooth and inclusive transition, reviewing all systems involved in building and testing code is essential. This includes CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, branch naming conventions, and platforms like Netlify. Special attention should be given to external configurations especially those not tracked by version control and any rules tied to specific branches, such as protected branch settings. This careful review helps maintain consistency and prevents disruptions during implementation.

### Branch Renaming Strategy

Renaming branches (e.g., replacing "master" with "main") follows a tiered approach:

- Start with **low-impact repositories** like documentation.
- Move to **core systems** gradually.
- Old branches are set to **read-only** temporarily to prevent breakages.
- Contributors are notified at least **one month in advance** to prepare.

#### Communication & Community Engagement

No successful transition happens in silence. INI emphasizes **clear, open, and proactive communication** throughout the process:

- Regular updates explaining what‚Äôs changing and why.
- Transition timelines for developers and users.
- Guidance on how to adopt inclusive terms in personal and organizational projects.

To safeguard contributors, especially those advocating for these changes, communities are encouraged to implement **moderation policies** and foster respectful dialogue.

### Join the Movement

The Inclusive Naming Initiative isn‚Äôt just about changing words, it‚Äôs about **changing mindsets**. By examining the language we use every day, we can help build a tech culture that reflects the values of **respect, diversity and belonging**.

We are inviting **leaders, contributors, open-source communities, and forward-thinking organizations** to join us in shaping a better, more inclusive future. Whether you‚Äôre a developer, project manager, writer, or executive, your voice matters.

**Become a [contributor](/participate). Be part of the shift. Let‚Äôs build tech that includes everyone.**
