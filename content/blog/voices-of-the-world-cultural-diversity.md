**Why Language Isn't Universal and That's a Good Thing**

In the previous [blog post](/blog/power-of-words/) we explored how inclusive naming helps shape equitable systems in tech. But inclusion doesn’t stop at replacing a few terms, it’s about recognizing the richness of voices from all over the world and how culture influences communication.

As we move further into the global digital era, it's critical to understand that language is not neutral. It's a reflection of identity, tradition, and worldview. And in the tech industry, where collaboration is increasingly cross-border and multicultural, this understanding can make the difference between building systems that exclude or empower.

## **Celebrating Language Through Culture**

This second phase shines a light on the diversity of voices across the globe. We're highlighting how language is shaped by culture, context, and community, and why honoring that matters in everything from code to customer service.

### **Different Cultures, Different Expressions**

Every language carries its rhythm, structure, and soul, deeply influenced by the culture it originates from. Here are some examples:

- **Nigeria**: With over 500 languages spoken, Nigeria's linguistic diversity reflects its rich cultural tapestry. Language here often conveys collective identity and respect for hierarchy. For an in-depth analysis, refer to the article on [Language and Culture: Nigerian Perspective](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309277107_Language_and_Culture_Nigerian_Perspective).[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309277107_Language_and_Culture_Nigerian_Perspective)
- **Japan**: Honorifics and formality are deeply embedded in both spoken and written Japanese, reflecting cultural values of respect and harmony. To understand the intricacies of Japanese honorifics, explore this comprehensive guide on [Honorific Speech in Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific_speech_in_Japanese).
- **Germany**: The German language is known for its compound words and logic-based grammar, supporting precision and structure, qualities mirrored in its strong engineering reputation.

### **How This Shapes Tech Communication**

This diversity affects how instructions are followed, how feedback is given, how error messages are understood, and even how collaborative tools are used. A culturally insensitive phrase in one region might unintentionally confuse or offend. A “direct” message, meant as efficient, could be read as “harsh” in another culture.

### **Inclusive Language = Culturally Aware Language**

When we speak about inclusive naming, we must also speak about cultural relevance. It's not just about removing offensive terms, it’s about choosing words that are clear, respectful, and accessible to people from all walks of life.

## **What We’re Doing Differently**

As part of the objective of this initiative, we are 

- Building language-aware tools — Promoting tools that support multilingual documentation, translation support, and culturally sensitive UX writing.
- Encouraging empathy-driven design — Tech teams are being urged to consider how localized language, time zones, symbols, humor, and tone affect global user experience.
- Challenging Anglocentrism — While English remains dominant in tech, it’s time to question its default status. Multilingual spaces deserve equal attention and respect.

## **Words Build Bridges**

The words we use can build bridges or create barriers. By celebrating linguistic and cultural diversity, we are doing more than avoiding exclusion; we are embracing connection, empathy, and innovation.

Let’s build systems, communities, and cultures that reflect the real world’s richness, one word, one voice, and one culture at a time.
