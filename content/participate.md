There are a number of ways you can participate in the INI community.

Advocates are members of our community who are activity contributing to our work, this can be helping to review submitted terms, issue triage  or submitting pull requests on GitHub. Activities advocates can engage in includes but not limited to:

- Suggest terms to be included in our Wordlist.
- Review terms suggested by others. Emails are automatically sent to advocates when new terms are suggested.
- Share and talk about the initiative at work, community or social media.
- Advocates who are technical can help with issue triages and contributions to our [GitHub projects](https://github.com/inclusivenaming), especially the [website](https://github.com/inclusivenaming/website)

#### View the project board and file issues

The [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/inclusivenaming/projects/1) is where we track the work being done for the Inclusive Naming Initiative. You can also file issues for work you'd like to see or open questions you have via the [inclusivenaming/org repository](https://github.com/inclusivenaming/org/issues).

#### Make changes in your projects

Use the resources we've compiled so far–the [Word replacement list](/word-lists/overview), [Implementation path](/language/implementation-path), and the [Language evaluation framework](/language/evaluation-framework)–and start making changes in your own projects! This is the most impactful way to get involved and help us achieve our goal as an initiative.

#### Approach other projects

Outreach to other projects, to encourage them to change their language, needs to be handled carefully, patiently, and
compassionately. We've collected some [tips on approaching projects](/outreach) to increase your chances of success.
