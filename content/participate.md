## Participate!

There are a number of ways you can participate in the INI community.

### General Community

You can be a part of the general community, learning and sharing with other members:

- **Join the mailing list:** [inclusivenaming@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/g/inclusivenaming). Send an email to <inclusivenaming+subscribe@googlegroups.com> if you want to use a non-Google email address.
- **[Join the slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/inclusive-naming/invite)**
- Join public meetings, the [meeting calendar](/calendar) is always up to date and you can get invitations to the meetings via the mailing list!
- Follow us on Twitter: [@inclusivenaming](https://twitter.com/inclusivenaming) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/inclusive-naming/)


#### View the project board and file issues

The [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/inclusivenaming/projects/1) is where we track the work being done for the Inclusive Naming Initiative. You can also file issues for work you'd like to see or open questions you have via the [inclusivenaming/org repository](https://github.com/inclusivenaming/org/issues).

#### Make changes in your projects

Use the resources we've compiled so far–the [Word replacement list](/word-lists/overview), [Implementation path](/language/implementation-path), and the [Language evaluation framework](/language/evaluation-framework)–and start making changes in your own projects! This is the most impactful way to get involved and help us achieve our goal as an initiative.

#### Approach other projects

Outreach to other projects, to encourage them to change their language, needs to be handled carefully, patiently, and
compassionately. We've collected some [tips on approaching projects](/outreach) to increase your chances of success.

## Join as a collaborator

Collaborators are active volunteers who help to run the activities of the Initiative.

#### Leads

Leads are composed of the Initiative's founders & CNCF Staff. The main role of the Leads is to help run the initiative and coordinate community activities. You can view the list of leads on the [leadership](/leadership) page.

#### Sponsors Forum

The Sponsors forum is a quarterly interactive virtual meetup where the progress of the initiative is shared with sponsors. The meetup is attended by representatives nominated by sponsors, they are able to share their feedback or make proposals to advance the efforts of the initiative. The representatives can also be reviewers or maintainers of INI projects.

#### Reviewers

Reviewers are passionate about inclusivity and seek ways to contribute to inclusive language efforts. A reviewer commits a couple of hours a month to review new term submissions and share their perspectives towards the recommendation of the term. The workflow of a reviewer is as follows:

- A reviewer is added to a dedicated mailing list where new terms and other communications are sent
- A reviewer collaborates with other reviewers via issues, slack or Google Docs
- Where a vote is required, a reviewer votes on the adoption of a recommendation.
- A reviewer can also be a Maintainer


#### Maintainers

Maintainers are familiar with GitHub and have technical knowledge to contribute to the website projects. Maintainers' activities include the following:

- Triage issues in the [website](https://github.com/inclusivenaming/website) and [org](https://github.com/inclusivenaming/org) projects, keeping them updated and ensuring they don't become stale
- Create code changes or Pull requests to update the wordlist and website project
- Collaborate with leads on tooling for the projects
- Advise and provide support as available to the initiative.
- Time commitment is 1-2 hours per week
- A contributor can be a reviewer and a maintainer.
